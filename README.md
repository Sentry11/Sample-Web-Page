# Overview
This project was developed as a template for future developments.
The project is a web page with active routing.
The objective of this project was to apply the skills of writing websites using tailwind.  
But as practice has shown, there is a lack of development on pure tailwind in the form of some bugs that I would like to avoid in the future. Therefore, a couple of elements of the site was written by using some scss.  
This app is full-responsive
